I went home and bought the ebook. And I couldn't stop reading it. ​I finished it in 3 hours. The book frightened me. Even if one can suppress the emotional attachment to a young 13 year old girl. What scared me was that the book highlighted something which was really frightening. It was like chaos theory going wrong. How a wrong set of initial hypothesis in the investigation led to the catastrophic failure of the system until the very end.  It felt like a worst case scenario happening. Everything which could have gone wrong in the investigation had gone wrong. I dont think the case could have gotten any worse than this. I kept telling myself this is a true story and not some fiction. I was hoping to see if there was any point where things stop going down. And it felt like the first CBI investigations team was leading in that direction. And then the team changed, and everything returned to its downwards spiral. I remember watching this case in the news, back when it happened. Back then i couldn't make heads or tails of what was happening. The investigation teams were making conflicting statements. It was something which I never could understand. So, I stopped following the news. Mr. Avirook's book is the first source of clarity in this whole case. At the end, Mr. Avirook convinced me that this was not an investigation but a witch hunt. ",,,,,,0,,,,,
